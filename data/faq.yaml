- name: I do not totally understand which problems it solves? <br> Like, do you have an real world example?
  answer: >
    To say you the truth - I still not understand how to describe this in short terms. <br>
    Well, let me say how I get idea about this project with my problem.<br>
    <br>
    I worked under SIP server. <br>
    The simple SIP call were transfered approximetly 20 microservicies <br>
    From time to time, I was needed resolve any bugs with SIP calls. <br>
    The problem was how to aggregate dumps, logs, configurations from 20 microservicies during the call? We had the ELK, but this don't have the all information, that I need (for example, tcp dumps). <br>
    I did the first version of Daggy that provides me the next solution: <br>
      1. I did <a href="https://docs.daggy.dev/#getting-started-data-aggregation-and-streaming-with-daggy-console-application">sources config</a> where I decribed all microservircies with any data streams and configs, that I intrested <br>
      2. I run the Daggy with this config <br>
      3. I did the SIP call <br>
      4. I stop the Daggy <br>
      5. I had all information about the call on my localhost - each stream were saved in separate file. <br>
    <br>
    Hope, this example will help you understand, which problem I solved with Daggy ) <br>
    Btw, Daggy also streaming at runtime - it means that files are writing as data arrives. Moreever, in release 2.1 the C++/C library for streams catching were added

- name: Which data types I can aggregate with Daggy?
  answer: >
    The data types are not limited, because Daggy not analyze data, it aggregate data.<br>
    You can set <i>extension</i> in <a href='https://docs.daggy.dev/data-aggregation-snippets'>Data Aggregation Snippet</a>, for example, <b>pcap</b>, and analyze it with Wireshark

- name: Can I sniff network traffic with Daggy?
  answer: Yes, you can! For example, see next <a href='https://docs.daggy.dev/data-aggregation-snippets#dump-entire-network-traffic-for-remote-host'>Data Aggregation Snippet</a>

- name: Can Daggy replace Ansible?
  answer: >
    Data Aggregation Config looks like ansible playbook with stripped down functionality.<br>
    The main goal of Ansible is deploying applications.<br>
    The main goal of Daggy is Data Aggregation.<br>
    Therefore Daggy provides simple way for simultaneous run multiple commands on multiple servers with runtime commands output streaming into separate files.

- name: Can Daggy replace logstash?
  answer: >
    Yes, you can aggregate logs from your network with Daggy.<br>
    Just, use <b>Data Aggregation Snippet</b> <a href='https://docs.daggy.dev/data-aggregation-snippets#journald-logs-streaming'>like this</a><br>
    In contrast of Logstash, the solution based on Daggy will be serverless.

- name: How Daggy does compare with other ssh multiplexers, like sslh, taktuk and others?
  answer: >
    1. Daggy can run commands on localhost without ssh<br>
    2. Daggy can run different sets of commands on different sets servers (taktuk, for example, can run only one command on set of servers)<br>
    3. Daggy has <a href='https://github.com/synacker/daggy/blob/master/docs/.gitbook/assets/simple_multiple_servers.yaml'>human readable config</a><br>
    4. Daggy streams output of commands to your local folder at runtime by default - separate file for each command.<br>
    5. Daggy is crossplatform. It means, that one data sources config can be run from multiple types of hosts (Windows, MacOS, Linux).<br>
